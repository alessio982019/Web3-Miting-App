Our vision focuses on one crucial point: financial opportunities are well known to all, but what about opportunities for personal growth? We are a group of young skateboarders from the decentralized world who philosophically see pumpkins as a reflection of society. 
What is the purpose of skateboarding? The skateboard is for moving quickly. A tool through which one can explore the world faster.  
  The plants represent the possibility of growing together. 
The various traits we have created represent the beauty of diversity. In their incredible journey, the pumpkins will grow through the experience and advice of other pumpkins around the world.  The metaverse is a window to the future, but let's not forget that the world outside is waiting for our hand.  We want to be part of progress with good goals. Let's do it hand in hand. Together!
